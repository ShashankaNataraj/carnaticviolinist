title: The Philosophy of Staircase Gamification

description: My workplace recently started labelling every 4th stair with a
  motivational quote and a calorie counter and I feel compelled to take the
  stairs now, just so I can read the motivational quotes in the morning. In this
  piece I extrapolate this phenomenon into a philosophical question.

I tried to take the stairs many times in 2019. It was a tiring affair. Im out of breath by the time I reach the 7th floor of the building where I work. It becomes a physically strenous activity when I climb 7 floors more than once a day. Though this was good for my health because I needed the cardio, I started finding excuses to not take the stairs. “I will go to the gym in the evening and exercise for another half an hour to make up for this”, I used to tell myself. The problem is, in the evening, I used to get distracted with something else and end up excusing myself from going to the gym. “I will climb the stairs tomorrow morning to make up for the evening workout”. Repeat ad nauseum.

Does the simple act of pasting a negative calorie counter and a motivational quote “trick” my brain into doing something that it doesn’t want to?

Recently, I have started training myself to not make up excuses and just stick to my regimen, which I find is very weird if you think about it.

* Who is this person who is complaining
* Who is this person whose complaints I’m suppressing?

Aren’t both of them “Me”?

More specifically, aren’t both of them, my brain? If yes, why is my brain contradicting itself? Why does it want to skip exercising when it knows “I” want to exercise?

The most perplexing part of these questions is that this entire dialogue is being carried on **and witnessed** in the brain!
